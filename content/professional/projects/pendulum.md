In a postgraduate course on applied control, [METR6203](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=METR6203), we were asked to develop a feedback control system to swing-up and balance and inverted pendulum using Matlab and Simulink for modelling and the plant [ECP 750](https://www.ecpsystems.com/docs/ECP_Gyroscope_Model_750.pdf) for testing.

This is just a highlight page with a video, but you can read more about the project on my [blog](blog/pendulum).
