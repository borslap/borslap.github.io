In one of my courses on additive manufacturing, I learned about generative design algorithms. To test my understanding, I decided to design a weight-optimized handlebar mount for my bike computer.

Below are the geometric constraints, specific to the composite handlebar mechanical design.

After a bit of iteration with load cases and geometry constraints in Fusion360, I was able to generate what looked like a promising part.
