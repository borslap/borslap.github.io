Hi there! I'm Bor, an engineering graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Queensland. 

I love aerospace engineering, computer systems, and have a keen interest in the industries that are advanced by these fields.

Although my interests in aerospace engineering are diverse, ranging from fluid dynamics and flight mechanics simulation, it was during my thesis and postgraduate research that I found myself captivated by onboard software systems.

Outside of work, I actively seek out new experiences that broaden my horizons. This thirst for exploration aligns with my approach to engineering challenges.
