Hi there! I'm Bor, a 24-year-old graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Queensland. My academic journey has been quite the adventure, leading me to discover my true passion: guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems engineering.

Although my interests in aerospace engineering are diverse, ranging from aerothermodynamic simulation to flight mechanics, it was during my thesis and postgraduate research that I found myself captivated by onboard software systems. To bridge the gap between my mechanical engineering background and this newfound interest, I eagerly pursued elective courses in computer science and electrical engineering, propelling myself into the exciting field of aerospace GNC system development.

Currently, I'm proud to serve as a graduate research assistant at the esteemed UQ Centre for Hypersonics. Here, I'm immersed in cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of aerospace technology.

Beyond academia, I thrive on outdoor adventures and sports. Whether I'm hiking through rugged terrain or exploring new destinations, my adventurous spirit is always fueled by curiosity and excitement. So, whether you're seeking a thrilling escapade or an engaging conversation about the latest advancements in aerospace engineering, I'm your guy!
