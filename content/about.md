Twenty-four-year-old Master of mechanical engineering graduate from The University of Queensland. My academic path has not been the most direct, but ultimately my passion and experience have converged on the topic of guidance, navigation and control (GNC).

Apart from control engineering and mechatronics, I am fascinated with all core areas of aerospace engineering, such as aerothermodynamic simulation and analysis, orbital dynamics and flight mechanics, but during my thesis and postgraduate research work I have become interested in onboard software systems.

This has led me into pursuing a series of elective courses in computer science and electrical engineering in to springboard me into the field of aerospace GNC system development as a professional engineer. I am currently working as a graduate research assistant at the UQ Centre for Hypersonics.

In my personal life, I enjoy sports, being outdoors, travelling and exploring.
