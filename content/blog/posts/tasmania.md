## TLDR

Cheesy blog about my recent roadtrip around Tasmania with K. A bit of a spontaneous and under-planned trip -- just how I like it. 

## Hobart \& Around

We landed in Hobart on Christmas eve, rented a van get around with and off we went. The first day was a bit murky and we just spent most of it scavenging around the city for food where we found some malatang and packed our van full of picnic foods for the upcoming Christmas day.

One of the highlights was Maria Island, where we saw a bunch of wombats, who would walk up to us.

## Mt Ossa Overnighter Hike

One of the coolest things about this trip was the 2-day hike that my twin-brother friends Ben and James took us on. Here are a few highlights:

We camped in the Pelican hut campsite and cooked some mulled wine after dinner.

The next day, we began the hike towards the summit and the weather started clearing up.

Eventually we got to the summit and the views were pretty awesome.

Then we headed back and on the way back to Launceston, we saw an ikidna crossing the road!
